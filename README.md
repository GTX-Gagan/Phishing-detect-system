Background
Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and effective cyber threats, tricking users into divulging sensitive information through fraudulent websites. This system aims to empower users and organizations by detecting phishing URLs before harm is done.

Features
URL Analysis: Examines URLs for suspicious patterns and components.

Blacklist Checking: Compares URLs against known phishing blacklists.

Machine Learning Model: Uses trained models to classify URLs as safe or phishing.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line or web interface to input URLs.

Real-Time Detection: Provides fast and accurate phishing detection results.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python (primary)

Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Flask (if web app included)

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / (add your model name)

Others: Requests, BeautifulSoup (for URL content scraping), etc.

(Modify this section to fit your actual tech stack)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/GTX-Gagan/Phishing-detect-system.git
cd Phishing-detect-system
Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Download pre-trained models or data files if provided.

Usage
Run the detection script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Input the URL to be tested when prompted:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter URL to check: http://example.com
Review the output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
URL is classified as: SAFE
(Optional) For batch URL analysis:

Provide a file containing URLs, then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python batch_check.py urls.txt
How It Works
The system performs phishing detection by:

Feature Extraction: Extracts features from the URL such as length, presence of suspicious tokens, domain age, etc.

Blacklist Comparison: Checks if the URL exists in known phishing databases.

ML Classification: Applies a trained machine learning model to classify the URL based on extracted features.

Decision Output: Returns the classification result to the user with confidence scores.

Contributing
Contributions are highly appreciated! Here's how you can help:

Report bugs or suggest features by opening GitHub issues.

Fork the repo and create feature branches.

Submit pull requests with clear descriptions of your changes.

Write tests and ensure existing tests pass.

Please follow the Code of Conduct (if you add one).

Troubleshooting
Issue: Errors during installation or missing dependencies.
Solution: Make sure to use the correct Python version (e.g., 3.7+) and install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt. Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

Issue: Model prediction accuracy is low.
Solution: Try retraining the model with updated datasets or tuning hyperparameters.

Issue: URL scraping fails for certain websites.
Solution: Check network connectivity or update scraping logic to handle site-specific HTML structures.

Roadmap
Add GUI/web interface for easier usage.

Integrate with browser extensions for live phishing alerts.

Improve ML models with deep learning techniques.

Maintain updated phishing URL databases.

Add support for email phishing detection.
